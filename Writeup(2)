After opening Cisco Packet Tracer,created a new file then I selected a router,a switch and two PC's.
Using copper straingt cable I connected PC0 to switch, then router to switch and PC1 to switch.
Then assigned IP address to the router.
Then after assigned IP address to both the PC's.
After that opened the Command Prompt of the PC0, and used the following commands:
     1.ipconfig :
              it displayed the current ip network configuration values

     2.tracert <ip configuration>:
              it traced the path taken to the destination by sending echo request messages

     3.telnet <destination IP> <port> :
             it is used for interactive communication with another host.
Now assign IP address to the router.

     4.ping 192.168.2.2:

     5.nslookup:

Add one server and connect both PC's and the server to the switch using copper straight-through cables.
Assign IP address to the server (192.168.1.3) and default gateway as (192.168.1.1).

      6.nerstart:
